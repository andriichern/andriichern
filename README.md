### Hi ðŸ‘‹ I'm Andrii.

I'm a software developer from Kiev, Ukraine.

Iâ€™m currently giving a ninja spells to a platform that hosts numerous web sites built in React.
I'm also conjuring on a backend API for that platform written in Node.JS (Fastify) and talking to different DBs.

I spend my free time learning Data Science and Web Dev for now.

Fan of functional programming.
